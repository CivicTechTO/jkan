  <h1>About this portal</h1>
  <p>This is a community-maintained effort to collect all Toronto datasets in a single system, whether they originate from the city or from <b>citizens</b>.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p>The city-maintained datasets are collected through the use of <a href="https://github.com/CivicTechTO/scrapers-to-data-portal">automated web scrapers</a> that the community maintains together.</p>
  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Collect official datasets in one place.</b>Different arms of the city run <a href="http://opendata.tplcs.ca/">various</a> <a href="http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=1a66e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD">data</a> <a href="http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/statistics/stats.php">portals</a>. These can be merged into one place.</li>
    <li><b>Allow citizen datasets as first-class objects.</b>Citizens often create their own datasets. These should live in the same system as the city's officially released datasets.</li>
    <li><b>Allow citizens to share transformed datasets.</b> Citizens often write scripts to transform data to clean it up or transform it into more useful file formats. These should be available along-side the original resources.</li>
    <li><b>Normalize dataset and organizational metadata.</b> Lots of metadata on the portal seems to be entered freeform, and so there are inconsistencies that we can resolve.</li>
    <li><b>Implement a dataset versioning system.</b> Many official datasets will disappear, or update without notice. The community would benefit from a caching layer to provide change management.</li>
  </ul>
